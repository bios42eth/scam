Overview
ELO stands for Effortless Order Foods. ELO is designed to reward users for their orders.
The pre-sale platform currently allows users to buy ELO tokens before our public launch.
The staking functionality will allow holders to stake their tokens and earn rewards, while the trading interface is aimed at providing liquidity and facilitating transactions among users.
It has features such as a user-friendly interface for purchasing tokens, wallet integration, and basic transaction tracking.
Need to expand this by adding staking options to incentivize holding ELO tokens and a trading interface to provide liquidity.
